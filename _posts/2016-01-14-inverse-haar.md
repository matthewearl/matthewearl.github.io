  In 2001 Viola and Jones introduced their successful face (and other object)
  detection algorithm, based on so-called Haar-like features. This post
  describes how I used mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and Python to
  write a script which inverts this algorithm; instead of detecting faces in an
  input image, it will generate an image of a face.

## Introduction

I've previously mentioned face detection in my [Face swapping
post](/2015/07/28/switching-eds-with-python/). The face detection step there
uses the popular "cascade of Haar-like features" algorithm to get initial
bounds for faces in an image.

In this post I describe a script I wrote to invert this face detection
algorithm: Instead of taking an image and telling you whether it contains a
face, it will generate an image of a face, using nothing more than cascade
data.

As always, full source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/
matthewearl/inversehaar).

## Haar Cascades

In 2001 Viola and Jones introduced their revolutionary [object detection
algorithm based on cascades of Haar-like
features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Viola%E2%80%93Jones_object_detection_framework), enabling for the first time
real-time detection of faces (and other objects) in video data.

At its core, the algorithm accepts a small (typically 20x20) image along with
some precomputed cascade data (described below), and returns whether or not the
object of interest is present there.  One can then just apply the core
algorithm to the full image in multiple windows, with the windows at various
scales and positions, returning any where the core algorithm detected the
object:

{% include img.html src="/assets/inverse-haar/major_opt.gif" alt="Header" %}

It is this core algorithm that I'm attempting to invert in this post. But how
does it work? Well, it's based on so called Haar-like features:

<img src="/assets/inverse-haar/feature1.png" alt="Feature 1" />
<img src="/assets/inverse-haar/feature2.png" alt="Feature 2" />
<img src="/assets/inverse-haar/feature3.png" alt="Feature 3" />
<img src="/assets/inverse-haar/feature4.png" alt="Feature 4" />

Each feature is associated with a threshold to form a so-called *weak
classifer*.  If the sum of the pixel values in the black region subtracted 
from the sum of the pixel values in the white region exceed the threshold then
the weak classifier is said to have passed. For example, the weak classifier in
the first image is detecting a dark area around the eyes compared to above the
cheeks.

Features are all defined with axially aligned rectangles and take one of a
few basic forms, as shown above. They are defined on the same small (eg. 20x20)
grid as the input image.

Weak classifiers are combined into *stages*. A stage passes based on which
weak classifiers associated with the stage pass; each weak classifier has a
weight associated with it, and if the sum of all the passing weak classifiers'
weights exceeds a *stage threshold* then the stage is said to have passed.

The stages, weak classifiers and associated weights are calculated by running a
training algorithm on thousands of positive and negative training images. See
the [Viola-Jones paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/courses/LBMV07/Papers/
viola-cvpr-01.pdf) for more details.

If all the stages in the cascade data pass then the algorithm returns that an
object has been detected.

This can be written in Python like:

{% highlight python %}
def detect(cascade, im):
    for stage in cascade.stages:
        total = 0
        for classifier in stage.weak_classifiers:
            if numpy.sum(classifier.feature * im) >= classifier.threshold:
                total += classifier.weight
        if total < stage.threshold:
            return False
    return True 
{% endhighlight %}

The input image `im` is assumed to already have been resized to the small
cascade size.  `classifier.feature` is an array the same shape as `im`, with
`1`s at points corresponding with white areas of the feature, `-1`s at points
corresponding with black areas of the feature, and `0`s elsewhere.  Note the
actual algorithm as described by Viola and Jones uses integral images to add up
pixel values, one of the reasons for the algorithm's fast operation.

The main reason for the multiple stages is efficiency: Typically the first
stage will contain only a handful of features, but can reject a large
proportion of negative images. There are typically hundreds of features in a
particular cascade, and a dozen or more stages.

## Mixed integer linear programming

In order to invert the `detect` function described above, I express the 
problem in terms of [Mixed integer linear programming](https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming), and then apply a MILP solver to the
linear program.

Here's the `detect` function described in terms of MILP constraints. First the
constraints to ensure a weak classifer passes, if it is required to. Lets call
these *feature constraints*:

$$ \forall j \in {positive\_classifiers} \ \colon \ \Bigg(
M_{j} (1 - {passed}_j)\ + \sum_{i=0}^{N_{pixels} - 1} {pixel}_i {feature}_{j,i}
                                                   \geq threshold_{j} \Bigg) $$

$$ \forall j \in {negative\_classifiers} \ \colon \ \Bigg(
   -M_{j} {passed}_j\ + \sum_{i=0}^{N_{pixels} - 1} {pixel}_i {feature}_{j,i} 
                                                      < threshold_{j} \Bigg) $$

...and a set of constraints to ensure that each stage passes. Let's call these
*stage constraints*:

$$ \forall k \in [0, {N_{stages}} - 1] \ \colon \ \Bigg(
        \sum_{j \in {classifiers}_k}  {passed}_j * {weight}_j \geq
                                                   stage\_threshold_k \Bigg) $$

Where:

* $$ {pixel}_i \in [0, 1], 0 \leq i < N_{pixels} $$ are the pixel values of the
  input image. (Corresponds with `im` in the code.)
* $$ {feature}_{j,i} \in \mathbb{R}, 0 \leq j < N_{classifiers},
  0 \leq i < N_{pixels} $$ are the weight values of the feature associated with
  weak classifier $$ j $$.  (Corresponds with `classifier.feature` in the
  code.)
* $$ {threshold}_j $$ is the threshold value of weak classifier $$ j $$.
  (`classifier.threshold` in the code.)
* $$ {weight}_j $$ is the weight of weak classifier $$ j $$. (Corresponds
  with `classifier.weight` in the code.)
* $$ {positive\_classifiers} $$ is the set of classifier indices with
  positive weights, ie. $$ \{ j \in [0, N_{classifiers} - 1] : {weight}_j > 0
  \} $$
* $$ {negative\_classifiers} $$ is the set of classifier indices with
  negative weights, ie. $$ \{ j \in [0, N_{classifiers} - 1] : {weight}_j < 0
  \} $$.
* $$ {passed}_j \in \{0, 1\} $$ is a binary indicator variable, corresponding
  with whether weak classifier $$ j $$ has passed.
* $$ M_{j} $$ are numbers chosen to be large enough such that if the term they
  appear in is non-zero, then the inequality holds true.
* $$ {classifiers}_k $$ is the set of weak classifier indices associated with
  stage $$ k $$.
* $$ stage\_threshold_k $$ is the stage threshold of stage $$ k $$.
  (Corresponds with `stage.threshold` in the code.)

The variables to be sought by the MILP solver are the $$ {pixel}_i $$ and
$$ {passed}_j $$ values. The rest of the values are derived from the cascade
definition itself.

The main thing to note is the use of $$ {passed}_j $$ as an indicator variable,
ie. how its state can turn on or off one of the feature constraints.  For
example, take $$ j \in {positive\_classifiers} $$. If a particular solution has
$$ {passed}_j $$ as 1, then we better be sure that the feature $$ j $$ actually
exceeds the classifier's threshold, as it is contributing positively towards
the stage constraint passing. In this case the $$ M_{j} (1 - {passed}_j) $$
term in the relevant feature constraint is zero, ie. the constraint is "on".

Conversely, for a classifier $$ j $$ with a negative weight, we only care that
the feature *doesn't* pass its classifier threshold if $$ {passed}_j $$ is 0.

With this in mind, it's clear that `detect(cascade, im)` is `True` if and only
if there's a solution to the linear program derived from `cascade` where the $$
{pixel}_j $$ variables take on the corresponding pixel values in `im`.

## MILPs in Python

I chose to use the [docplex](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docplex) module to
write the above constraints in Python. With this module constraints can be
written in a natural way, which are then dispatched to [IBM's DoCloud
Service](https://developer.ibm.com/docloud/) for solving remotely. Note DoCloud
requires registration and is not free, although they offer a free month's
trial which is what I used for this project.  I did initially try solving the
problem with the free [PuLP](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PuLP) module, with
which I had limited success either due to the underlying solver being less
sophisticated or limitations of my machine.

As an example, here's how the variables are defined:

{% highlight python %}

from docplex.mp.model import Model

model = Model("Inverse haar cascade", docloud_context=docloud_context)

pixel_vars = {(x, y): model.continuous_var(
                name="pixel_{}_{}".format(x, y)
                lb=0., ub=1.0)
                for y in range(cascade.height)
                for x in range(cascade.width)}
passed_vars = [self.binary_var(name="passed_{}".format(idx))
                                       for idx in range(len(cascade.features))]
{% endhighlight %}

And an (abridged) snippet which adds the stage constraint:

{% highlight python %}
for stage in cascade.stages:
    model.add_constraint(sum(c.weight * passed_vars[c.feature_idx]
                                        for c in stage.weak_classifiers) >=
                                                               stage.threshold)
{% endhighlight %}

The problem is then solved by calling `model.solve()`.

If succesful, the pixel variable values are extracted from the solution, and
converted into an image (a `numpy` array) which can then be written to disk
using `cv2` (or similar).

{% highlight python %}
im = numpy.array([[pixel_vars[x, y].solution_value
                    for x in range(cascade.width)]
                  for y in range(cascade.width)])
cv2.imwrite("out.png", im * 255.)
{% endhighlight %}

By default, `docplex` will just search for a feasible solution. However, one
can set an objective like so:

{% highlight python %}
model.set_objective("max",
    sum((c.weight * passed_vars[c.feature_idx] 
            for s in self.cascade.stages
            for c in s.weak_classifiers)))
{% endhighlight %}

This objective will try and find the solution which most exceeds the stage
constraints. It can take an unreasonably long time to find the true maximum, so
we can set a time limit:

{% highlight python %}
model.set_time_limit(60 * 60)
{% endhighlight %}

This line instructs the solver to stop after an hour and output the best
solution found so far (if any).

See the [source code](https://github.com/matthewearl/inversehaar) for the full
details. Note the code there is a little more complex due to supporting tilted
features and also because of the format of the cascade data in OpenCV, but the
essence is the same.

## Results

Here's the output of running the program on OpenCV's
`haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml` cascade for an hour:

{% include img.html src="/assets/inverse-haar/face_max_3600.png" alt="Face max" %}

Not bad. Shame about the low resolution, but that's unavoidable given the
features are only defined on a 20x20 grid. Here is the same image blurred,
which is more convincingly face-like:

{% include img.html src="/assets/inverse-haar/face_max_3600_blurred.png" alt="Face max blurred" %}

And to test the limits of the detector, lets minimize the stage constraint
instead of maximising:

<img src="/assets/inverse-haar/face_min_3600.png" alt="Face min" />
<img src="/assets/inverse-haar/face_min_3600_blurred.png" alt="Face min blurred" />

Decidedly less face-like, but should still be detected by OpenCV.

Here's the best eye image (based on `haarcascade_eye.xml`)

<img src="/assets/inverse-haar/eye_max_3600.png" alt="Eye max" />
<img src="/assets/inverse-haar/eye_max_3600_blurred.png" alt="Eye max blurred" />

...and the worst:

<img src="/assets/inverse-haar/eye_min_3600.png" alt="Eye min" />
<img src="/assets/inverse-haar/eye_min_3600_blurred.png" alt="Eye min blurred" />

Here's the best profile face image (based on `haarcascade_profileface.xml`):

<img src="/assets/inverse-haar/profileface_max_3600.png" alt="Profile face max" />
<img src="/assets/inverse-haar/profileface_max_3600_blurred.png" alt="Profile face max blurred" />

...and the worst:

<img src="/assets/inverse-haar/profileface_min_3600.png" alt="Profile face min" />
<img src="/assets/inverse-haar/profileface_min_3600_blurred.png" alt="Profile face min blurred" />
